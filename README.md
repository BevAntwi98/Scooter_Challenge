# Electric Scooter Hire App

## Requirements:
* To hire a scooter, a user must download the Electric Scooter Hire app and register their details
* Only users 18 years and above can ride a scooter
* Scooters are rented from charging stations
* There are multiple charging stations in the city
* Only fully charged scooters can be rented
* A scooter must be returned to a charging station
* It takes 2 hours to fully charge a scooter from empty
* Payment is taken once the user has returned their scooter
* A scooter can be marked by a user as broken. This must remove the scooter from a list of available scooters and trigger maintenance personnel to repair the scooter
* The maximum range of a fully charged scooter is 32 km

## Assignment
To complete the assignment you must create the following:

Design your solution by creating the following UML diagrams

* A UML Use Case diagram showing the interactions between the user Actor, scooter Actor and the Electric Scooter Hire app system
* A UML Class diagram showing the system's classes, their attributes, methods and inter-relationships
* A UML Sequence diagram showing the interactions between the user Actor, the Scooter Actor and the classes in the system
* Screenshots of your UML diagrams must be committed to your Github repository. You may want to get the diagrams checked by your coach before starting to code.

Implement your system as follows:

* Create a new Node.js project for this assignment.
* A /src directory containing classes with interactions (methods calls) that capture the required functionality
* A /tests directory containing unit tests (including async tests for the charging functionality) which test all scenarios
* A screenshot of your unit test coverage report (aim for 100% coverage)
Commit your code into Github and share the link with your coach for review.

## Notes for coach :)
### This project is around 90 ish % complete, had around 2 tests and a couple functions to fix in User.js. 
* I also attached images of the failed tests
